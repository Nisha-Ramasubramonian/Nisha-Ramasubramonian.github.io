[**Subway Reviews** ](https://github.com/Nisha-Ramasubramonian/Subway-Reviews)

- Consulted with business strategy team to guide offers, strategies, and programs. Used data insight visualization techniques (such as bar charts and scatter plots) to support or disprove the following statements made by the Subway Restaurant Executives:
  - **Head of Customer Service:** “Our ratings are gradually improving, and we will soon reach 4.5/5.”
  - **Head of Store Operations:** “Sandwiches are a tricky business. All sandwich chains suffer from poor customer ratings.”
  - **Head of Social Media:** “The goal of 4.5/5 is unreasonable for national chains like us. Only small, local, and boutique restaurants can achieve such high ratings.”
  - **Chief Data Scientist:** “It is well known that customers make the effort to give a rating only when they are either extremely angry or absolutely delighted with the service. So online ratings are not reliable.”
-	Demonstrated the ability to take complex ideas and KPIs and Communicate results and related findings through Python (matplotlib, seaborn, scipy, and pandas)  to the Customer Service Team by preparing presentations using data visualizations (line charts, bar charts, scatterplots, groupedby dataframes, and linear regression) and identifying key takeaways of popularity and ratings. 
-	Consult with business strategies to guide offers strategies and programs using data and insights to determine the trajectory of 5-star reviews for sandwich shops by calculating average ratings and analyzing Subway rating trends across 50 states over ten years to determine popularity.
-	Organized 22 million records into data frames and merged them based on business criteria for efficient integration. This led the team to notice a downward trend, prompting the conclusion that reaching a 4.5/5 stars average was unreasonable.
-	Calculated average ratings and analyzed Subway rating trends across 50 states over ten years to determine popularity.
